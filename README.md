# OS

This is a dummy operating system that exists merely as a sandbox
for me to learn os development. This isn't interesting in the least.
Even potatoes have more function than this OS. But I've still licensed
it under MIT 'cause why the fuck not.

A couple of quirks:
 - You need to have a folder named 'bin' in the repository directory
   with a 720KB blank file in it named boot.img in order to build this.
 - The aforementioned boot.img file is a floppy disk drive image (I know,
   floppies...) that can be loaded up using a VirtualBox vm. That's all
   the OS consists of atm.

That's all you need to know.
